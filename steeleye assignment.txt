1. Explain what the simple List component does.

The simple List component is a React component that creates an unordered list (ul>) element from a list of items.Each item, consists of a SingleListItem component that displays some text and has a background color that changes depending on whether it's selected or not.
When the user clicks on an item, the List component updates the selected index and keeps track of it.
Memorization is a technique used by the List component to prevent unnecessary re-rendering of its child components. The component also has an effect hook that fires whenever the item support changes, and resets the selectedIndex state variable to null.
The SingleListItem component is passed the necessary props, including the onClickHandler, which sets the state variable selectedIndex to the index of the clicked item.
